# Project Title: DoSecure File Sharing and Managing Solution

## Overview

This project is designed to provide a secure solution for sharing and printing user files such as images, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, etc. The primary use case is to address the risk of misuse of files when printing at print shops. Typically, after printing, files remain on the print shop’s devices, posing a risk of unauthorized access and misuse. This solution enables users to share files via unique links that allow printing but prevent downloading, ensuring the security and privacy of the files.

## Features

1. **File Upload and Sharing**:
    - Users can upload various types of files (images, Word, PPT, PDF, etc.).
    - Each file is assigned a unique link for sharing.
    - The shared link allows the recipient to print the file but not download it.

2. **Role-Based Authentication**:
    - **User**: Can upload and share files.
    - **Admin**: Manages users and has access to additional administrative functionalities.

3. **Secure Printing**:
    - Files can be printed directly from the link without the option to download.
    - Ensures files are not stored on the print shop’s devices after printing.

4. **React Libraries and RESTful APIs**:
    - Utilizes various React libraries for a seamless user experience.
    - Implements RESTful APIs for efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

5. **Backend Structure**:
    - Follows the Model-Controller-Service pattern for better code management and utilization.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Role-based
- **File Storage**: Locally

## Installation and Setup
